# ðŸ§­ Implementation Plan: OGC API Connected Systems Client

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for integrating support for the OGC API - Connected Systems standard into the [`camptocamp/ogc-client`](https://github.com/camptocamp/ogc-client) TypeScript library. Development is tracked in [Sam-Bolling/ogc-client](https://github.com/Sam-Bolling/ogc-client) with the intent to contribute upstream via [Issue #118](https://github.com/camptocamp/ogc-client/issues/118).

## âœ… Goals

- Modular client using composition
- Flexible query interface using `Record<string, string>`
- Support for Systems, Observations, System History, Commands
- Full test coverage and documentation
- Capability detection for conditional exposure
- Compliance with CSAPI spec via modular implementation
- Contribution to upstream repo with maintainable design

---

## ðŸ§  Architectural Rationale (TypeScript)

This implementation follows the modular design patterns used in the upstream `camptocamp/ogc-client` TypeScript library. Rather than extending the main client via inheritance, CSAPI functionality will be encapsulated in a dedicated `ConnectedSystemsClient` class and composed into the main client instance.

This approach mirrors how EDR support is integrated â€” using capability detection and conditional exposure â€” and ensures that CSAPI logic remains isolated, testable, and maintainable.

### Key Design Principles

- **Composition over inheritance**: CSAPI logic is injected as a property (`connectedSystems`) only if the server advertises support.
- **Modular client structure**: Each API (Features, EDR, CSAPI) lives in its own file and namespace, promoting separation of concerns.
- **Capability detection**: The main client will expose `.connectedSystems` only if CSAPI-specific links or metadata are present.
- **Type safety**: All query parameters and responses will use TypeScript interfaces and `Record<string, string>` for flexible filtering.
- **Testability**: Each method will be covered by unit tests using `vitest` or `jest`, with mock responses for isolated validation.

This design ensures that CSAPI support can be added without disrupting existing functionality, and can be cleanly merged back into the upstream repo via a pull request referencing [Issue #118](https://github.com/camptocamp/ogc-client/issues/118).

## ðŸ“œ Compliance Note

This implementation is compliant with the OGC API - Connected Systems specification based on modular support for core entities. Additional entities will be added incrementally. Capability detection ensures that unsupported endpoints are not exposed, preserving interoperability and graceful degradation.
