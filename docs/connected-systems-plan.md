# ðŸ§­ Implementation Plan: OGC API Connected Systems Client

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for integrating support for the OGC API - Connected Systems standard into the `camptocamp/ogc-client` repository. Development is tracked in [Sam-Bolling/ogc-client](https://github.com/Sam-Bolling/ogc-client) with the intent to contribute upstream via [Issue #118](https://github.com/camptocamp/ogc-client/issues/118).

## âœ… Goals
- Modular client using composition
- Dictionary-based query interface
- Support for Systems, Observations, System History, Commands
- Full test coverage and documentation
- Capability detection for conditional exposure
- Compliance with CSAPI spec via modular implementation
- Contribution to upstream repo with maintainable design

---

## ðŸ§  Architectural Notes

> CSAPI logic will be implemented in a dedicated module (`connected_systems.py`) using composition rather than inheritance. This mirrors the design used in the EDR implementation, promoting modularity, capability-based exposure, and separation of concerns.

> Initial implementation will focus on core CSAPI entities. Additional entities will be added modularly to maintain compliance while enabling incremental development.

## ðŸ“œ Compliance Note

This implementation is compliant with the OGC API - Connected Systems specification based on modular support for core entities. Additional entities will be added incrementally. Capability detection ensures that unsupported endpoints are not exposed, preserving interoperability and graceful degradation.
