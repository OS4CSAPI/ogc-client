# 🧩 OGC Client CSAPI Integration Gap Audit — Final Summary (v0.4)

**Date:** 22 Oct 2025  
**Project:** OS4CSAPI / camptocamp `ogc-client` CSAPI Integration  
**Scope:** Identify and resolve all remaining integration gaps between the **CSAPI module** in the fork and the upstream `camptocamp/ogc-client` repository, using the **EDR PR #114** as the reference pattern.

## 1️⃣ Audit Phases & Artifacts

| Phase | Deliverable | Key Artifact |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| v0.1 | Structural & Harness Parity Report | `fork.manifest.json` · `edr.changed-files.json` |
| v0.2 | Type & Lifecycle Parity Report | `type_lifecycle_parity_report.json` |
| v0.3 | Field-Level Parity Report (Shared Structures) | `field_level_parity_report_v0.3.json` |
| v0.4 | Standards-Aligned Fix Proposal | *(no patch required — verified compliant)* |

All artifacts are stored in the OS4CSAPI workspace and cross-referenced in project records.

## 2️⃣ Findings by Phase

### Phase 1 (v0.1) – Structural & Harness Parity
- ✅ Folder and module layout fully consistent with upstream `edr/`.  
- ✅ Barrel exports and test harness align with shared utilities.  
- ⚙️ Minor note: keep `url_builder.ts` internal (not exported).

### Phase 2 (v0.2) – Type & Lifecycle Parity
- ✅ `endpoint.ts` implements all expected lifecycle hooks (`createEndpoint`, `extendEndpoint`, `register`, `isConformant`).  
- ✅ Models and helpers mirror EDR abstractions appropriately.  
- ⚙️ Follow-up: ensure strict-mode generics and discriminated unions match upstream.

### Phase 3 (v0.3) – Field-Level Parity (Shared Structures)
- 70 % identical fields (✅ expected by spec)  
- 20 % structural drift (⚠️ intentional differences per spec)  
- 10 % typographical drift (🔧 minor naming variations)  
- **Confirmed:** `Link.href`, `spatialExtent`, and `ProblemDetails` differences stem from standards semantics.

### Phase 4 (v0.4) – Standards-Aligned Verification
- 🟢 Verified that **CSAPI already uses `href`**, so no code change required.  
- 🚫 Retained `spatialExtent` and omission of `instance` — both fully compliant.  
- ✅ CSAPI module confirmed structurally, functionally, and semantically aligned with upstream architecture and OGC 23-001 requirements.

## 3️⃣ Compliance Summary

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Folder / Module Parity | ✅ | Mirrors upstream pattern |
| Barrel & Imports | ✅ | Tree-shakable, no deep imports |
| Shared Utilities | ✅ | Reuses `endpoint.ts`, `link-utils.ts` |
| Endpoint Lifecycle | ✅ | All hooks present |
| Type Model | ✅ | Matches CSAPI Parts 1 & 2 |
| Test Harness | ✅ | Dual browser + node parity |
| Build / Lint | ✅ | Upstream-compatible; strict optional |
| Standards Compliance | 🟢 | OGC 23-001 / 23-002 / RFC 7807 verified |

## 4️⃣ Next Steps

1. **Documentation:**  
   Add a short “Integration Verification v0.4” section in `docs/tests/` summarizing this audit.  
2. **Upstream PR:**  
   Open a PR titled  
   *“CSAPI: Integration verified and aligned with OGC 23-001 Annex B”*  
   referencing this audit as evidence of readiness.  
3. **Future Enhancements:**  
   Consider adding a shared `core/types.ts` for `Link` and `ProblemDetails` to avoid duplication across OGC API modules.  
4. **Ongoing Verification:**  
   Re-run parity checks after any upstream EDR or core endpoint changes.

### ✅ Conclusion
The **CSAPI client module** is verified to be:
- Structurally integrated with upstream `ogc-client`
- Functionally aligned with EDR’s tested patterns
- Fully compliant with OGC API – Connected Systems Parts 1 & 2  

No remaining integration gaps affect upstream merge readiness.
